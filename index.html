            <h3>You got this</h3>
            <p>By now, you've probably heard from at least a couple people that this is going to be a challenge.</p>
            <p><strong>But we believe in you!</strong></p>
            <p>Some weeks will be harder than others, and everyone will find different things difficult.</p>
            <p>Ask for help, lean on each other, and remember that being bad at something is just the first step to being good at something!</p>

            <h3>Embrace mistakes</h3>
            <p>Coding attracts perfectionists. We're kind of bad at being okay with screwing up, but learn to lean into the discomfort.</p>
            <p>Write a lot of code, don't be afraid of making a mistake (or a lot of mistakes), delete stuff and try again!</p>

            <h3>Ask questions and help each other</h3>
            <p>Everyone is going to pick things up at different speeds. When you're getting it, offer help to others. When you need help, just ask!</p>
            <p>Don't beat yourself up when you feel like you're falling behind. It just means you're learning to learn - like a developer.</p>

            <h3>Get as much Javascript practice as you can</h3>
            <p>It helps to get as much exposure to Javascript as possible! Learn the vocabulary, plan out your code. Write it on paper. Say your code out loud!</p>
            <p>Get familiar with how to use the right terms (like variable, assign, method, parameter). Plus, you'll sound super smart and impress the heck out of everyone.</p>

            <h3>Pin things on Slack</h3>
            <p>This is not a particularly inspiring tip for success, but OH MAN just trust us - it will save you so. many. headaches.</p>
            <p>Pin important links in your slack channels - links to resources, assignments, important announcements, etc. Slack is busy and important stuff gets buried fast. Pin it early so everyone can find the relevant info!</p>

            <h3>Pre-read, re-read</h3>
            <p>Whenever possible, look over the lessons the evening or morning before. Sometimes, the instructors aren't able to get through a whole lesson before time runs out. Work with your mod to come up with times when you can go over the lessons together to lock in those foundations. Re-read lessons - they're great resources!</p>

            <h3>Participate in Turing community events</h3>
            <p>We know there's a lot to absorb during Mod 1. Give yourself time to get your bearings, then take the plunge and try stuff out!</p>
            <p>Join a posse (student groups), attend spikes (student workshops), LEAD a spike, go to Meetups. It can feel cheesy, but it's a chance to start building your network in the tech world.</p>

Ask for one-on-ones with the instructors. Talk about your struggles with your cohort. Go find a mentor (which is scary at first but really rewarding and helpful!).</p>

            <h3>Stick together</h3>
            <p>This isn't a competition - TRUST your cohort. You're all going through the same things. Chances are, if you're struggling, so are others. If you've figured it out, share your thought process freely.</p>
            <p>You are each other's best resources. Twenty heads are better than one!</p>

            <h3>Be kind to yourself</h3>
            <p>Keep doing the things you love to do in your spare time. Spend time with friends. Exercise. Eat well. Sleep enough. Pick times to just enjoy yourself and relax! There's no need to think about coding 24/7 - instead, do the things that ground you and make you happy.</p>
            <p>Happy, well-rested humans write better code than grumpy, sleep-deprived humans. It's science!</p>
